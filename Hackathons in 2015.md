# Hackathons in 2015

The following is a list of hackathons that were held in Australia in 2015. The main purpose of this list is to provide some background knowledge for an upcoming (maybe?) blog post on my personal blog.

Please note: hackathons that have events held at various cities on the same day (e.g. GovHack and HealthHack) are counted seperately. 

Credits for the data can be found at the very end of the post.
